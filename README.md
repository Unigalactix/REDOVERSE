# The Redo Universe

Welcome to the Redo Universe, a new beginning for life and civilization located 34 light-years from Earth. This name was chosen by human migrants to symbolize a second chance. The system is characterized by its unique dual-star celestial mechanics, diverse planets, and intricate societal structures.

## The Planetary System

The entire system revolves around two central stars in a unique lemniscate (figure-eight) orbit.

### Central Stars
*   **Spica**: A brilliant blue star.
*   **Antares**: A radiant red star.

### Planets
There are four known planets in the system:
1.  **Zan (also known as Death)**: The primary planet, rich with diverse life and complex societies.
2.  **Casa**: A "twin planet" to Judo, featuring three moons. Its bioforms are yet to be discovered.
3.  **Judo**: A "twin planet" to Casa, with no moons or known life forms.
4.  **Flack**: The smallest and outermost planet in the system. It is inhospitable and has no moons.

## Deep Dive: Planet Zan

Zan is a world of incredible complexity, from its temporal cycles to its unique inhabitants. Its symbol is one of bliss, symbolic of death.

### Celestial & Temporal Structure

**Day and Year Cycle:**
*   **Day Length**: A single Zanian day lasts for **36 hours**, with varying periods of daylight and darkness.
*   **Orbital Period**: A full year on Zan takes **782 days**.

**The Zanian Year Loop:**
The year is divided into six distinct phases, each marked by a dominant color in the sky:
*   **Phase 1 (P1)**: Purple - 118 days
*   **Blue Phase (B)**: Blue - 150 days
*   **Phase 2 (P2)**: Purple - 116 days
*   **Phase 3 (P3)**: Purple - 118 days
*   **Red Phase (R)**: Red - 162 days
*   **Phase 4 (P4)**: Purple - 116 days

**Darknight:**
The transition between years is marked by a special 6-day period of extended darkness known as **Darknight**. This period consists of the last three days of Phase 4 and the first three days of Phase 1. The new year officially begins after Darknight concludes.

### Physical & Environmental Aspects

*   **Atmosphere**: Life is sustained by a balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases.
*   **Geography**: The planet's surface is composed of 60% land and 40% water.
*   **Gravity**: Due to the dual-star system, gravity on Zan fluctuates. It is most unstable during the purple phases and most stable during the blue and red phases.
*   **Biodiversity**: Zan is home to seven major races and nearly 387 minor animal and plant species.

### Regions and Inhabitants

Zan's society is segregated into distinct regions, each with its primary inhabitants.

*   **Zan Region**: Inhabited by the **Zan Zanians**, who are predominantly clones.
*   **Death Region**: Populated by the **Death Zanians**, who are naturally born beings.
*   **Hades Ocean**: This vast ocean, making up all of the planet's water, is the underwater home of the **Aqua Zanians**, the original bioforms of Zan.

### Societal Structure & Species

**The Moon Tribes:**
*   Zan's four moons are home to mixed tribes: **Agape, Ales, Alyx, and Andel**.
*   These tribes are a unique experiment by an entity known as "Team Recreation," consisting exclusively of male clones and naturally born females, tasked with producing the first generation of hybrid offspring.

**Aqua Zanians:**
*   **Hybrid Aqua** beings reside along the coast of the Zan Region.
*   **Pure-breed Aqua** beings are found along the coast of the Death Region.
*   A classification process exists for "Artificial Aquinas" based on their skin's reaction to being burned. Natural Aquinas are immune. The outcome of this test determines whether they live on the coast or inland with their genetic parents.

## Development & Deployment

This project is set up using Vite for a fast development experience and an optimized production build.

### Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**: You'll need Node.js and npm installed. Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run Development Server**: To start the local development server with live reloading, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready version of the app, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command bundles all the code into a `dist` folder, which is optimized and ready for deployment.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

You can host this project for free using GitHub Pages.

1.  **Build the Project**: Run `npm run build` to create the `dist` directory.

2.  **Push to GitHub**: Make sure your project is a GitHub repository and you have pushed all your code. You may need to commit the `dist` directory if it's in your `.gitignore` file.

3.  **Configure GitHub Pages**:
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Click on the **Settings** tab.
    *   In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    *   Under "Build and deployment," for the **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   For the **Branch**, select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and choose the `/dist` folder from the dropdown menu.
    *   Click **Save**.

4.  **Done!**: After a few minutes, your site will be live at the URL provided by GitHub Pages (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`).
